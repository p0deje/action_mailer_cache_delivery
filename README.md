## Action Mailer Cache Delivery [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/p0deje/action_mailer_cache_delivery.png)](http://travis-ci.org/p0deje/action_mailer_cache_delivery) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/action_mailer_cache_delivery.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/action_mailer_cache_delivery)

Enhances ActionMailer to support the `:cache` delivery method, which behaves like `:test`, except that the deliveries are marshalled to a temporary cache file, thus making them available to other processes.

You'll want to use this gem if you're testing with Selenium (or any other tool which distinct processes). Another approach would be to [share deliveries between threads](https://gist.github.com/p0deje/ffc833630ee70f2af5ff) (in this case, this gem is not needed at all).

## Installation

Add to Gemfile

```ruby
gem 'action_mailer_cache_delivery'
```

Now run `bundle install`

## Usage

Change delivery method in your `config/environments/test.rb`

```ruby
config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :cache
```

You can optionally specify location for cache file.

```ruby
config.action_mailer.cache_settings = { :location => "#{Rails.root}/tmp/mail.cache" }
```

To access the cached deliveries in another process, just do

```ruby
ActionMailer::Base.cached_deliveries
```

## Use with parallel_tests

If you use [parallel_tests](https://github.com/grosser/parallel_tests "parallel_tests") to run your tests in parallel, you may get unexpected errors like `EOFError`. If so, make sure cache files differ for processes. Change you `config/environment/test.rb`

```ruby
config.action_mailer.cache_settings = { :location => "#{Rails.root}/tmp/cache/action_mailer_cache_delivery#{ENV['TEST_ENV_NUMBER']}.cache" }
```
